# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the Github Flow
I am a common boy and i'm new in Github ,although my english is really poor and my coding ability is not exsiting.In fact ,I need to do many things to improve myself and i think that changes,good changes,are extremely needed for me .
Maybe i will start use Github to express myself and try to share and help others.
Now,my situation is really bad .I often feel really down.I'm straped in many questions.I think that my thoughts/views on things have many problems.
I need change,and i hope i can really change!
later i'll revise those sentences,maybe not.I hope to less grammer problems.
